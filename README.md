# Playground for `semantic-release` with PHP

This repository is a simple PHP project:

- a class called `Something`, with a `sayHello` static function
- basic tests to test that project

The CI is configured to install all required tools to run `semantic-release` to release a new version depending of the kind of commit when required.

Changelogs, Git tags and GitHub releases are also updated.
